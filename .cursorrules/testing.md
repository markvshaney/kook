# Testing Guidelines

This document outlines the testing approach, best practices, and conventions for ensuring code quality and reliability throughout the project.

## Testing Philosophy

1. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Write tests before implementing functionality when possible
   - Focus on behavior over implementation details
   - Use tests as design documentation

2. **Test Coverage Goals**
   - 85%+ coverage for core AI infrastructure code
   - 70%+ coverage for memory systems
   - 90%+ coverage for critical user-facing functionality

3. **Testing Pyramid**
   - Unit tests: Fast, focused tests for individual functions and classes
   - Integration tests: Verify communication between components
   - System tests: End-to-end validation of functionality
   - Performance tests: Validate memory usage and execution speed

## Testing Tools

1. **Framework Selection**
   - Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript unit and integration testing
   - React Testing Library for component testing
   - Playwright for end-to-end testing
   - PyTest for Python ML code testing

2. **Mocking and Fixtures**
   - Use mocks for external dependencies (databases, APIs)
   - Create reusable fixtures for common test scenarios
   - Prefer dependency injection to facilitate testing

3. **Test Data**
   - Maintain separate test datasets for different components
   - Version control large test datasets using Git LFS
   - Create synthetic data generators for edge cases

## AI-Specific Testing

1. **Model Testing**
   - Test model loading with different configurations
   - Verify quantization accuracy and performance
   - Test memory footprint with different sequence lengths
   - Validate model outputs against golden datasets

2. **Memory System Testing**
   - Test vector embedding generation and similarity search
   - Verify importance scoring algorithms
   - Test memory consolidation correctness
   - Validate retrieval with different query types

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmark inference speed with and without optimizations
   - Measure memory usage during load and runtime
   - Test system behavior under low-memory conditions
   - Profile and optimize critical execution paths

## Testing Structure

```typescript
// Example: Unit Test Structure
describe('Quantizer', () => {
  describe('quantizeWeights', () => {
    it('should reduce memory footprint with 8-bit quantization', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should handle empty weights array', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    it('should apply different quantization methods correctly', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });

  describe('estimateMemoryUsage', () => {
    // Tests for memory estimation
  });
});
```

## Test File Organization

1. **Directory Structure**
   - Place test files alongside the code they test with `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extension
   - Group test utilities in `__tests__/helpers` directories
   - Store test fixtures in `__fixtures__` directories

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - Name test files with the same name as the file they test (e.g., `quantization.test.ts`)
   - Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested
   - Group related tests with nested `describe` blocks

3. **Test Tags**
   - Tag tests with appropriate categories:
     - `@unit` for unit tests
     - `@integration` for integration tests
     - `@slow` for time-consuming tests
     - `@memory` for tests requiring significant memory

## Best Practices

1. **Test Independence**
   - Each test should run in isolation
   - Avoid test interdependencies
   - Clean up resources after each test

2. **Test Readability**
   - Use the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Include descriptive failure messages
   - Document complex test arrangements

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Run unit and fast integration tests on every PR
   - Schedule slower tests for nightly builds
   - Monitor test coverage trends over time

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Set up baseline performance metrics
   - Alert on significant performance regressions
   - Include memory profiling in CI pipeline

## Specialized AI Evaluation

1. **Accuracy Metrics**
   - Define domain-specific evaluation metrics
   - Implement evaluation harnesses for specialized tasks
   - Track performance across different model versions

2. **Hallucination Detection**
   - Implement specific tests to detect model hallucinations
   - Validate factual accuracy against reference datasets
   - Measure consistency across multiple queries

3. **Forgetting Measurement**
   - Test for catastrophic forgetting across fine-tuning cycles
   - Measure memory retention with standardized benchmarks
   - Validate temporal consistency in long-term memory
