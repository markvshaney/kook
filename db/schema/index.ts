/**
 * Database Schema Index
 * 
 * This file exports all database table schemas defined in the application.
 * It serves as the central point for schema definitions to be imported by the database connection.
 */

// Re-export all schema tables from their respective files
// Each schema file should define and export one or more database tables

// Core schemas will be added in future steps
// Temporary placeholder exports to satisfy imports in db.ts

// Future table exports will go here as they are created:
// export * from './users';
// export * from './sessions';
// export * from './content';
// export * from './memory';
// export * from './specializations';
