<think>The user is asking me to troubleshoot a terminal problem, but they haven't provided specific details about what the problem is. To help effectively, I need to:

1. First understand what terminal problem they're experiencing
2. Check if there's any error message or specific behavior to troubleshoot
3. Look at their environment to see if there are any clues

Let me first check the repository structure to understand the codebase better, and then I can ask more targeted questions about the terminal issue.</think>I'll help you troubleshoot the terminal problem. First, let me explore your project structure to understand the context better.

Let me check the project steps to understand the context better:

---

_****_

Read file: project_steps.md

---

_****_

Now, let's also check the package.json to understand what scripts and dependencies you have:

---

_****_

Read file: package.json

---

_****_

Based on what I can see so far, you have a Next.js project with several scripts defined in your package.json. However, you haven't provided specific details about what terminal problem you're experiencing.

Let me check if there are any issues with your environment configuration:

---

_****_

```bash
node -v && npm -v
```

```
PS C:\Users\lbhei\source\kook> node -v && npm -v 
v22.12.0
11.1.0
PS C:\Users\lbhei\source\kook>
```

---

_****_

Your Node.js (v22.12.0) and npm (11.1.0) versions are quite recent. Let's try to understand more about what kind of terminal problem you're experiencing. Let's check if there are any errors when trying to run your project:

---

_****_

```bash
npm run dev
```

```
PS C:\Users\lbhei\source\kook> npm run dev

> kook@0.1.0 dev
> next dev --turbopack

   â–² Next.js 15.2.2-canary.2 (Turbopack)
   - Network:      http://192.168.1.10:3000
   - Environments: .env.local

```

It looks like your Next.js development server started successfully without any errors. This suggests the terminal itself might be working correctly for basic commands.

Let's check a couple more things to understand your terminal environment:

---

_****_

```bash
echo $PSVersionTable | cat
```

```
PS C:\Users\lbhei\source\kook> echo $PSVersionTable | cat
Get-Content: The input object cannot be bound to any parameters for the command
either because the command does no
t take pipeline input or the input and its properties do not match any of the pa
rameters that take pipeline input.
```

---

_****_

Let me try a different approach for PowerShell:

---

_****_

```bash
$PSVersionTable | Format-Table -AutoSize
```

```
PS C:\Users\lbhei\source\kook> $PSVersionTable | Format-Table -AutoSize

Name                      Value
----                      -----
PSVersion                 7.5.0
PSEdition                 Core
GitCommitId               7.5.0
OS                        Microsoft Windows 10.0.26100
Platform                  Win32NT
PSCompatibleVersions      {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0â€¦}
PSRemotingProtocolVersion 2.3
SerializationVersion      1.1.0.1
WSManStackVersion         3.0

PS C:\Users\lbhei\source\kook>
```

---

_****_

You're using PowerShell 7.5.0 (Core), which is a recent version. 

Without specific details about the terminal problem you're encountering, here are some common issues and checks we can perform:

---

_****_

```bash
npm ls next
```

```
PS C:\Users\lbhei\source\kook> npm ls next    
kook@0.1.0 C:\Users\lbhei\source\kook

PS C:\Users\lbhei\source\kook>

```

---

_****_

Let's check the current execution policy in PowerShell, which is a common source of issues:

---

_****_

```bash
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```

```
PS C:\Users\lbhei\source\kook> Get-ExecutionPolicy
RemoteSigned
PS C:\Users\lbhei\source\kook>
```

---

_****_

Your execution policy is set to RemoteSigned, which is generally appropriate for development work.

Based on the information I've gathered so far, I don't see any obvious terminal issues. To help you better, could you please provide more specific details about the terminal problem you're experiencing? For example:

1. Are you getting specific error messages?
2. Is the terminal not responding to certain commands?
3. Are you having trouble running particular scripts from your package.json?
4. Are you experiencing issues with PowerShell specifically?
5. Are you having problems with the terminal in Cursor or in a separate terminal application?

With more details about the specific issue, I can provide more targeted troubleshooting assistance.

whoami

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user has sent the command "whoami", which is a common command in terminals to identify the current user. Since this seems to be a request to run this command in the terminal, I'll use the run_terminal_cmd tool to execute it.</think>I'll run the "whoami" command to see your current user identity in the terminal:

---

_****_

```bash
whoami
```

```
PS C:\Users\lbhei\source\kook> whoami
logicalend\lbhei
PS C:\Users\lbhei\source\kook>
```

---

_****_

Your current user identity is `logicalend\lbhei`. This indicates you're logged in as user `lbhei` on the domain or computer named `logicalend`. This information confirms that your terminal is working correctly and is able to identify your user account.
