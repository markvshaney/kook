Choose One Primary System: Next.js apps, ESM

_**Assistant**_

<think>The user is asking me to choose "One Primary System" between "Next.js apps" and "ESM" (ECMAScript Modules). However, this is a bit confusing since Next.js apps typically use ESM as their module system.

From the attached information, I can see they have a Next.js project (version 14.2.24) running. Let me explore their project to get a better understanding of what they might be asking.

First, I'll check if there's a package.json file to understand the project structure better.</think>I'll help you explore your Next.js project to get a better understanding of its structure. Let me first check your package.json file to see the project configuration.

Based on the information I've gathered, I can now provide a response:

I see you're working with a Next.js project (version 14.2.24) that's configured to use ECMAScript Modules (ESM). Here are the key points about your current setup:

1. Your package.json has `"type": "module"` which indicates ESM is being used as the module system
2. Your tsconfig.json has `"module": "esnext"` and `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` which aligns with ESM
3. Your configuration files use the .mjs extension (next.config.mjs, postcss.config.mjs, eslint.config.mjs) which is also consistent with ESM
4. You're using Next.js with TypeScript and strict type checking

Since you asked to choose one primary system between Next.js apps and ESM, I should note that these aren't mutually exclusive choices. Next.js is a framework for building web applications, while ESM is a module system for JavaScript. In fact, modern Next.js applications typically use ESM as their module system.

For your project, I recommend continuing with Next.js using ESM, which is already your current setup. This modern combination gives you:

1. Next.js benefits:

   - Server-side rendering and static site generation
   - Optimized routing system
   - Automatic code splitting
   - Built-in image optimization
   - API routes support

2. ESM benefits:
   - Native browser support for modules
   - Static analysis capabilities
   - Tree-shaking optimization
   - Better support for async/await patterns
   - Clear dependency management

Would you like me to help you with any specific aspects of your Next.js + ESM setup or make any optimizations to your current configuration?

I see the issue now. Your package.json references `jest.config.mjs` in the test script, but this file doesn't exist in your project. However, I can see you have `jest.setup.js` and `tsconfig.jest.json`, which suggests you
