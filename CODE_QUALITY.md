# Code Quality Standards and Tools

This document outlines the code quality standards, tools, and processes used in this project to maintain high-quality code.

## Automated Quality Tools

### Pre-commit Hooks (Husky)

We use Husky to run pre-commit hooks that enforce code quality standards before code is committed:

- **TypeScript Type Checking**: Runs `tsc --noEmit` to catch type errors
- **ESLint**: Lints staged files to enforce coding standards
- **Prettier**: Formats code to ensure consistent style

### Linting (ESLint)

Our ESLint configuration enforces strict rules:

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: No implicit any, strict null checks, etc.
- **Documentation**: JSDoc requirements for public APIs
- **Code Style**: Consistent patterns and practices
- **Import Organization**: Proper import ordering and structure

### Formatting (Prettier)

Prettier automatically formats code to consistent standards:

- Double quotes
- 2-space indentation
- 100-character line length
- Semicolons
- Trailing commas for easier diffs

## Manual Quality Processes

### Code Reviews

All code changes should be reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged. Code reviews should check for:

- Adherence to code quality standards
- Design patterns and architectural consistency
- Test coverage
- Documentation completeness

### Quality Maintenance Sessions

The team should schedule regular quality maintenance sessions to address technical debt and improve the codebase.

## VS Code Integration

VS Code settings are provided to automatically enforce code quality standards during development:

- Format on save using Prettier
- Run ESLint fixes on save
- TypeScript integration

## Quality-Specific Rules for Test Code

Test code has special considerations:

- Console logs are allowed in test files
- Empty functions are allowed in certain test contexts
- Documentation requirements are relaxed for test utilities

## Comparison with Alternatives

### Why We Chose Husky

We selected Husky for Git hooks management because:

1. **Ecosystem Integration**: Seamless integration with npm/yarn workflows
2. **Widespread Adoption**: Well-documented with extensive community support
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to configure for our specific needs
4. **TypeScript Support**: Works well in our TypeScript-focused project

### Alternatives Considered

- **simple-git-hooks**: Lighter weight but less feature-rich
- **lefthook**: Faster but requires additional setup
- **pre-commit (Python)**: Better for polyglot repos but requires Python
- **Manual Git hooks**: More control but higher maintenance burden

## Getting Started

To start using the code quality tools:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
2. VS Code: Install the ESLint and Prettier extensions
3. Pre-commit hooks will run automatically when you commit

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the code quality tools:

- **ESLint**: Run `npx eslint --fix [file]` to fix issues automatically
- **Prettier**: Run `npx prettier --write [file]` to format a file
- **Husky hooks**: If a hook fails, fix the issues before committing again
- **Type Errors**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for type errors
